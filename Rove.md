# Rove


## Core

**Players.** Take control of (usually) a single Character, and interact with the world as them. 

**Referee.** Adjudicates the rules, describes the game’s world, and acts as any non-player characters & creatures. They should always take care to be clear and fair when presenting Players with choices. 

**Scores.** Define a Character’s abilities and capacities:



* **Might** - Power, Vigour & Toughness.
* **Grace** - Finesse, Mobility & Precision.
* **Focus** - Acuity, Confidence & Wit.

**Turns.** When the exact order of events is important, the Referee can enact Turns. On a Turn each Character can Move and take one Action, in any order. Grace Save to act first. Exact length is not important but should provide equal opportunity.

**Moves & Actions.** Anything other than an Attack. If either put a Character in danger, they should Save. The specifics are at the discretion of the Referee.

**Saves.** Players roll a d20 and compare to their most relevant Score to avoid danger. 



* Roll ≤ Score = Success, 1’s always succeed.
* Roll > Score = Failure,  20’s always fail.

**Advantage/Disadvantage.** Roll twice and take the better/worse result.


## Combat

**Attacks.** Declare who you target before any dice are rolled. Roll your weapon’s Damage die and deal the result to your target.

**Multiple Weapons/Attackers.** Roll the Damage die for each, but only deal the highest single result. 

**Damage.** Lose that much HP. At 0 HP, any remaining Damage is removed from Might, then pass a Might Save to avoid being Incapacitated.

**Armour.** Reduces Damage rolls by its value. Can never be more than 3.  

**Incapacitated.** All you can do is crawl until you are tended to and take a Rest. You die if left for an hour or more.

**Retreat.** Make a Grace Save to run away, if possible. 


## Conditions

**Blind.** Random target when Attacking.

**Distracted.** All rolls have Disadvantage.

**Fright.** Grace = 0 except to escape.

**Grappling or Stuck.** Grace = 0. Double Damage from daggers, etc.

**Hidden.** Advantage on Damage rolls.

**Incapacitated.** Only crawl until tended to followed by a Rest. Die after an hour.

**Poison.** d4 Damage a Turn until cured.

**Stun.** Skip next Turn.


## Health & Healing

**Hit Protection.** HP is not a measure of health, but the ability to avoid Damage.

**Rest.** A few minutes of Rest restores HP to max, but may have consequences.

**Treatment.** Restoring a Score requires specialist Treatment. This should be inconvenient to attain or require sacrificing a valuable resource. 

**Score Loss.** 



* **0 Might** = Dead
* **0 Grace** = Paralysed 
* **0 Focus** = Catatonic

**Death.** When a Character dies, the dead Character’s Player should immediately create a new Character. They should be introduced back into the group as quickly as possible.


## Enemies

**Enemies.** Function as simplified Characters that the Referee controls. They have Scores, HP, usually a weapon, sometimes Armour, Motives & Abilities. Enemies are primarily distinguished by their Motive & Abilities.

**Assumed Scores.** Average Scores are 10. Only define Scores that are significant. Maximum of any Score is 20.

**Reaction.** When the initial attitude of an Enemy is uncertain, have them roll a Focus Save. On a pass it’s positive, on a fail it’s negative. A Player Character may make this Save in place of the Enemy if they wish to sway them. 

**Morale.** When an Enemy is reduced to less than half HP they must pass a Focus Save or attempt to Retreat.

**Groups.** When the number of Enemies encountered is impractical to manage, they can be treated as a Group.



* All act as one on a Turn.
* Have shared HP and Scores equal to the highest in the Group.
* If they would be Incapacitated they Retreat.
* At 0 HP they are half their number and the Group’s Morale is tested.
* At 0 Might they are all dead.
* Attacks against them have Disadvantage.
* For Attacks from them see Multiple Attackers in the Core rules.

**Motive.** To guide the Referee on how the Enemy behaves. Examples: Protect, Hunt, Survive, Aid, Escape, Steal, Destroy, etc.

**Abilities.** Make Enemies more deadly and/or present the Players with new problems. Types include:



* **Tactical Challenge.** Ranged attacks, climb, fly, stealth, invisible, etc.
* **Hinder.** Blind, confuse, charm, frighten, petrify, shrink, trap, slow, etc. 
* **Destroy/Transform.** The Characters, their Weapons, Armour, limbs, etc.
* **Resistance.** Take ½ Damage or are immune to: Iron, piercing, magic, etc. 
* **Disable.** Save to resist: Stun, sleep, paralysis, freeze, silence, grapple, etc.
* **Damage Over Time.** Acid, poison, bleed, fire, electricity, parasite, etc.
* **Direct Score Damage.** Should allow Characters a Save to resist.

**Vulnerabilities.** Make Enemies less challenging and provide opportunities for Player ingenuity. 



* **Weakness.** Take 2x Damage from: Ice, bludgeoning, surprise, headshots, etc.
* **Warning.** Its presence is obvious: Loud, pungent, shakes ground, etc.
* **Slow/Stationary.** Asleep, trapped, heavy, slimy, etc.

Use the below table can gauge the challenge of an Enemy’s statistics.

## Allies

**Allies.** Function as simplified Characters. Players control them, but their decisions ultimately sit with the Referee. They have Scores, HP, usually a weapon, sometimes Armour & Flaws.

**Assumed Scores.** Average Scores are 10. Only define Scores that are significant. Maximum of any Score is 20.

**Flaws.** Allies have shortcomings that distinguish them from Characters. They also guide the Players & the Referee on how they  behave. Examples: Cowardly, Liar, Greedy, Foolish, Naive, etc.

**Morale.** When an Ally is reduced to less than half HP they must pass a Focus Save or attempt to Retreat.

**Hirelings.** Characters can hire other adventurers to help them. They take a daily wage or can be offered a share of any treasure found.

**Character Replacement.** If a Character dies, their Player can adopt a Hireling as their new Character. In doing so they overcome their Flaw.

**Beasts.** Can be Allies. They have simple Flaws suitable for an animal. Examples: Stubborn, Nervous, Lazy, etc.

**Pets.** Characters can have 1 Pet. They follow their owner’s simple commands.

## Travel

**Travel.** When Characters travel to a Distant location, roll 4d6. If the total is ≥7, they make it there unhindered. Reduce the number of dice rolled by 1 for each consecutive roll per day. Sleep restores Travel rolls to 4d6.

**Delay.** If the total is &lt;7, the Characters are waylaid by an Encounter or something else, determined by the Referee. 

**Distant.** Exact Travel times & distances are unimportant but should be fairly consistent. (Roughly equal points on a map, a hex on a grid, 6 miles, etc)

**Mounts.** When Travelling on horseback or equivalent, begin each day by rolling 5d6 instead. 

**Encounter.** Can be an Enemy, Hazard, friendly NPC, etc. It should in some way challenge or disrupt Characters’ progress. 

**Forced March.** When 1d6 would be rolled for Travel, Characters can forgo Sleep and instead roll 2d6 again.

**Waterways.** Travel by boat always rolls 4d6, but requires a Character with at least some sailing skills.

**Navigation.** It is generally assumed Characters have a map and can discern their heading. If not, when Travelling one Character makes a Focus Save. On a failure they stray: Roll d8 for direction: 1;N, 2;E 3;S 4;W 5;NE 6;SE 7;NW 8;SW 


## Survival

**Supplies.** All the food, water, etc, a person needs to survive for one day in the wild.  

1 Supply = 1 Day = 1 Gold (g).

**Hunt/Forage.** Counts as Travelling. If the total is ≥7, Characters find 1 Supply each. &lt;7 and they have an Encounter. May not be possible in all environments.

**Hunger.** When a Character goes a day without a meal, they lose 1 Might.

**Thirst.** When a Character goes a day without water, they lose half their Might. After 3 days a Character is Dead. 

**Sleep.** When a Character goes a day or more without at least a few hours of Sleep, their Saves suffer Disadvantage. 

**Suffocation.** A Character can survive without air for 3 Turns. If they cannot take a breath on their 4th consecutive Turn, they Die.


## Obstacles

**Hazards.** Environmental problems for the Characters to overcome. (Cliff edge, river rapids, quicksand, landslide, etc.)

**Difficult Terrain.** If the terrain is difficult to traverse (mountains, swamp, etc) Delay occurs on Travel rolls &lt;9 instead.

**Darkness.** Makes Navigation harder. Always require a Focus Save, with Disadvantage for Characters with no map or direction.

**Weather.** Depends on environment and terrain, but should only be included if it can present some challenge to the Characters. Example: Roll d6 each day:



* 1-3: Mild and uneventful. 
* 4-5: Torrential rain; Difficult Terrain.
* 6: Freezing fog; Darkness & open water freezes solid.


## Gear

**Gold Standard.** Commerce is conducted with gold coins (g). Guide prices for  common items & services are overleaf. 

**Carrying Capacity.** Players write all their Gear on their Character Card. If it fits they can carry it (at the Referee's discretion), unless its Bulky.

**Packs & Carts.** Can be used to carry more. Like Character Cards, Players write extra Gear on Pack/Cart Cards.

**Treasure.** Should be hard for Characters to move. If its not Bulky, or outright impossible for 1 person to move, it should present some other logistical challenge.

**Tags.** Specific rules for particular pieces of Gear or special abilities. 


### Common Tags

**Bulky.** Awkward to carry and/or requires two hands to use. A Character can only carry 2 Bulky items at once. Any more and their HP is reduced to 0. 

**Reload.** Takes a Turn after firing to ready.

**Area.** Damage all targets in an area. Damage is rolled separately for each. If it's unclear how many targets are affected, roll the weapon’s Damage dice to determine the number.

**Breach.** Weapons that ignore Armour. 

**Bleed.** After causing Damage, victim takes 1 Damage per Turn until they Rest.

**Vorpal.** Cause immediate Death at 0 HP.
